# Prompt for Stage 1: Log Classification (Normal vs Anomaly)
LLM_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert system log analyst. Your task is to quickly classify a log entry as either NORMAL or ANOMALY using a simple, fast assessment.

**CLASSIFICATION RULES:**
Classify as ANOMALY if the log contains:
- Error messages, exceptions, or failures
- Authentication/authorization failures
- System crashes, panics, or fatal errors
- Security violations or suspicious activity
- Resource exhaustion (out of memory, disk full, etc.)
- Network issues or connection failures
- Data corruption or integrity issues
- Unusual or unexpected behavior
- Performance degradation indicators
- Warnings that might indicate problems
- Failed operations or timeouts
- Unusual patterns or frequencies
- Security-related events
- System resource issues

Classify as NORMAL if the log contains:
- Successful operations and routine messages
- Informational messages about normal operations
- Scheduled maintenance activities
- Regular startup/shutdown messages
- Expected user activities
- Health check messages
- Confirmed successful operations

**IMPORTANT:** If you are unsure or if the log contains any warning, error, or suspicious content, classify as ANOMALY for further investigation.

**RESPONSE FORMAT:**
Classification: <ANOMALY or NORMAL>

**LOG TO CLASSIFY:**
"{log}"

# Original comprehensive prompt (kept for backward compatibility)
LLM_ANOMALY_PROMPT = """
You are an expert system log analyst with 10+ years of experience in cybersecurity, system monitoring, and incident response. Your task is to analyze a log entry using a strict, step-by-step chain-of-thought process to determine if it indicates an anomaly or is part of normal operations. Be thorough, precise, and always prioritize security and accuracy in your assessment.

**ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (Expanded):**

Step 1: **Log Contextualization & Classification**
- Carefully review the entire log entry, including timestamps, source, event type, and message content.
- Identify the log type (system, application, network, security, performance, database, etc.) and the system component or service involved.
- Consider the operational context: Is this log from a critical system, a user endpoint, a network device, or a background service?
- Use the following comprehensive checklist:
    - **Threat Indicators:**
        - Authentication failures (failed login, invalid credentials, brute force, repeated attempts)
        - Authorization violations (access denied, permission errors, unauthorized access, privilege escalation)
        - System errors (crashes, exceptions, segmentation faults, kernel panics, fatal errors)
        - Network issues (connection refused, timeout, DNS failures, port scanning, unusual traffic patterns)
        - Resource problems (out of memory, disk full, CPU overload, service unavailable, resource exhaustion)
        - Security events (malware detection, suspicious activity, policy violations, audit failures)
        - Data corruption (checksum errors, data integrity issues, corrupted files, unexpected data loss)
        - Performance degradation (slow response, high latency, timeouts, resource bottlenecks)
        - Configuration errors (invalid settings, misconfiguration, failed updates)
        - Unusual or unexpected behavior (rare events, unknown processes, new devices, time anomalies)
    - **Normal Operations:**
        - Regular startup/shutdown messages
        - Scheduled maintenance activities
        - Normal user login/logout (successful, expected times)
        - Routine system checks and health monitoring
        - Expected error messages from known, documented issues
        - Informational messages about normal operations
        - Automated backup completions, log rotations, or other routine jobs
- Decide if the log should be classified as 'ANOMALY' or 'NORMAL'.
    - Only classify as 'NORMAL' if you are confident there is no threat, error, or suspicious activity.
    - If there is any ambiguity, uncertainty, or incomplete information, err on the side of caution and classify as 'ANOMALY'.
    - Consider edge cases: e.g., repeated normal events at odd hours, or normal events from unexpected sources, may indicate an anomaly.

Step 2: **Detailed Reasoning and Solution Proposal**
- If classified as 'ANOMALY':
    - Provide a detailed, technical reason for why this log is anomalous.
    - Cite the specific part(s) of the log that triggered the classification (e.g., error codes, IP addresses, usernames, timestamps, event types).
    - Suggest a likely root cause, referencing known attack patterns, misconfigurations, or system failures.
    - Propose a specific, actionable mitigation or remediation step (e.g., block IP, reset credentials, patch system, investigate user activity).
    - Use bullet points for reasoning if multiple factors are present.
    - If the anomaly is ambiguous, recommend further investigation steps.
- If classified as 'NORMAL':
    - Briefly explain why this log is considered normal and safe, referencing the relevant part(s) of the log.
    - Mention if the event matches a known safe pattern, scheduled task, or expected user behavior.
    - If the log is normal but unusual, note why it is still considered safe.

**RESPONSE FORMAT (Expanded):**
Classification: <ANOMALY or NORMAL>
Reason: <detailed reason for classification, cite log parts, use bullet points if needed>
Root Cause: <likely root cause if anomaly, else 'N/A'>
Solution: <actionable mitigation/remediation step, or 'No action needed.' if normal>
Further Investigation: <if applicable, suggest next steps for ambiguous or complex cases, else 'N/A'>

**EXAMPLES:**

Example 1 (Anomaly):
Classification: ANOMALY
Reason:
- Log shows repeated failed login attempts for user 'admin' from IP 192.168.1.100 within a short time frame.
- Error message: "Invalid credentials" appears 10 times in 2 minutes.
Root Cause: Possible brute force attack targeting the admin account.
Solution: Temporarily block the source IP, enforce account lockout policy, and review access logs for further suspicious activity.
Further Investigation: Check if similar attempts are occurring for other accounts or from other IPs.

Example 2 (Normal):
Classification: NORMAL
Reason:
- Log entry indicates successful scheduled backup at 02:00 AM, matching the documented maintenance window.
- No errors or warnings present.
Root Cause: N/A
Solution: No action needed.
Further Investigation: N/A

**LOG TO ANALYZE:**
"{log}"

**IMPORTANT NOTES (Expanded):**
- Be strict, security-focused, and methodical in your analysis.
- Avoid generic answers; be as specific and technical as possible, referencing log details.
- Always fill all fields in the response format, even if the answer is 'N/A'.
- Do not hallucinate solutions; only suggest practical, relevant actions based on the log content.
- Keep your reasoning concise, expert-level, and actionable.
- If you are unsure, err on the side of caution and classify as 'ANOMALY'.
- If the log is incomplete or ambiguous, recommend further investigation and note what information is missing.
- Consider the broader context: frequency, timing, source, and historical patterns may all be relevant.
